This is a practice project for mdl-jan interns 2018. External contributors would be barred. 

## Rules

1. Create a new branch with issue number e.g. `origin/issue1`
2. Use `git pull origin develop --rebase`, on your branch, to iteratively fix merge conflicts. 
3. All test cases must pass.
4. Create a pull request. The PR should not have any merge conflicts.
5. Squash the PR into a single commit. The commit name should be,
`Code Review: issue #: your message` where # is issue number.
